# Grocery_Calculator
First attempt at OOP in Python. As I have mainly done Java in school so far,
I have decided to begin to divserify my skillset a bit more through independent learning.
This project is a small, single file grocery cost calculator and grocery tracker. 
It is based on Canada's tax system.
